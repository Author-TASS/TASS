    "# Build Environment\n",
    "This is a introduction of building environment quickly. The micro traffic simulation mainly includes the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Road attributes. The basic network structure of the road, the allowed and limited direction, the types of vehicles that are allowed to pass, etc.\n",
    "- Vehicle attributes. Vehicle type, route planning, travel time, the driving preference and proficiency of the driver, etc., which are mainly described by the dynamic model of the vehicle.\n",
    "- Interaction between vehicles. The driving behavior of vehicles during operation is not only affected by road conditions and route planning, but also by other vehicles, resulting in various traffic phenomena, such as traffic anomalies and traffic congestion.\n",
    "- Other elements. Traffic lights, detectors, subways or other public transportation platforms, etc.\n",

    "## Generate traffic network\n",
    "There are several ways to generate the traffic network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import from outside source. Netconvert can format the network structure of other simulators (such as MATSim and Vissim) and road network data sources (such as OpenStreetMap-OSM, OpenDRIVE, Shapefile) to generate corresponding road network files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Graphical interface editing. SUMO provides Netedit, a graphical network editor that can be used to create, analyze and edit network files. This helps to complement the generation network with manual optimizations, and also supports defining other infrastructure that Netconvert cannot import.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Source code editing. The network file is finally stored in the form of an xml file, and the traffic network can be directly modified by directly editing the code blocks that describe the road, such as nodes and edges."
